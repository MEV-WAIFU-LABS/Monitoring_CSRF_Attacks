# ðŸ’€ Monitoring CSRF Attacks ðŸ’€

A tool to monitor web server's log files against CSRF attacks. 

It is a nice example of parser in Ruby and Ragel, together with some examples in C++ and Python.

Some examples of modifications for modsecurity on Apache (used in examples in the program).

This was a final project for the Stony Brook graduate Computer Security class, taught by Prof. Sekar.
